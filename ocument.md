## Introduction
This is a sample Node.js application designed to demonstrate basic concepts and structure.

## Architecture
The architecture of the application is depicted in the following diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Client] --> B[Server];
    B --> C[Controller];
    C --> D[Service];
    D --> E[Database];
```

## Flow Diagram
The flow of the application is shown in the diagram below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Controller
    participant Service
    participant Database

    Client->>Server: HTTP Request
    Server->>Controller: Route Request
    Controller->>Service: Business Logic
    Service->>Database: Query Data
    Database-->>Service: Return Data
    Service-->>Controller: Processed Data
    Controller-->>Server: Response Data
    Server-->>Client: HTTP Response
```
